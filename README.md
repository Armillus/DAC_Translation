# DAC_Translation
A basic python script designed to translate files in order to create a FR Patch for the submod Divide and Conquer, from the video game Medieval II Total War crated by Creative Assembly.


This little script allows to translate text from english to french using Google Translation API
(which is not free, pay attention to this detail if you want to use this code). It is still experimental and could probably be improved.

The text folder contains original english files, whereas the translated one contains all the french equivalents, created and/or updated by the translation script.
