# DAC_Translation
A basic python program design to translate files in order to create a FR Patch for the submod Divide and Conquer, from the video game Medieval II Total War crated by Creative Assembly.


This little script allows to translate text from english to french using Google Translation API
(which is not free, pay attention to this detail if you want to use this code).
